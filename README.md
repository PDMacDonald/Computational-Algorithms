# Computational-Algorithms
Previous Python projects and homework assignments to test my knowledge on common algorithms for multiple applications. Programs are based on graduate level course work in numerical linear algebra and undergrad level course work in numerical methods and computational mathematics which both delt with computational algorithms.
